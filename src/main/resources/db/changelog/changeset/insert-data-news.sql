VALUES ('Discovery of Water on Mars',
        'NASA scientists have confirmed the presence of water molecules in Martian soil, specifically within the top few centimeters of the surface, a discovery that significantly impacts future Mars missions. Water on Mars could mean reduced costs and improved safety for future manned missions, as astronauts may be able to extract and use this water for drinking, growing food, or generating oxygen. This breakthrough also enhances the possibility that microbial life could have existed on Mars in the past, as water is a critical element for sustaining life.',

        'Observations from both ground-based and space telescopes have shown that Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth, is gradually shrinking. This storm has been raging for at least 350 years, but over recent decades, it has decreased significantly in size. Scientists speculate that changes in the planet’s atmospheric dynamics might be causing the storm to lose energy. Understanding this change can offer insights into Jupiter’s atmosphere, which may, in turn, provide clues about weather systems on other gas giants and exoplanets.',

This process, known as “ring rain,” is causing particles from the rings to be drawn into the planet’s atmosphere. Scientists estimate that Saturn’s rings might vanish within the next 100 million years, a relatively short time in cosmic terms. This revelation has sparked discussions on how and when Saturn’s rings formed, as they could be a much more recent addition to the solar system than previously thought.',
