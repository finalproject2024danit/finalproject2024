        'The universe is vast and full of mysteries. Scientists estimate there are over 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, each containing millions or even billions of stars. The sheer size of the cosmos is almost beyond human comprehension. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is just a tiny fraction of the universe, and it is still not entirely explored. From the tiny particles that make up atoms to the enormous galaxies that stretch across the sky,
        the universe holds secrets that scientists are still uncovering with advanced telescopes and space missions.', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),

    (2, 'Did you know that the Milky Way galaxy is about 100,
        000 light-years in diameter? It is home to our solar system and billions of stars, many of which have their own planetary systems. The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a central bulge of stars, surrounded by a thin disk that spirals outward. Recent discoveries suggest that the Milky Way is not static but is constantly moving and evolving, influenced by gravitational interactions with nearby galaxies. Astronomers continue to study its structure and history to understand how galaxies form and change over billions of years.',

        'Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. They form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles. The point at which no light can escape is called the event horizon, and anything that crosses this boundary is lost forever. Black holes can vary in size, from small ones formed by collapsing stars to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies. These supermassive black holes can have millions or even billions of times the mass of our Sun. They are essential to understanding galaxy formation and evolution, as their immense gravity can influence the movement of stars and shape the galactic structure.',

        'The first human to set foot on the Moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969 during NASAs Apollo 11 mission. His famous words were,
        "That is one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." This historic event marked the culmination of years of scientific research and space exploration,
        starting with the launch of the first satellites and leading to human missions to orbit the Earth. The Apollo missions not only showcased human ingenuity but also laid the foundation for modern space exploration. Scientists collected lunar samples,
        studied the Moons surface, and tested equipment for future space missions, all contributing to our understanding of space and the possibilities of human travel beyond Earth.',

        'Mars, often called the Red Planet, has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is about 13.6 miles high. It towers over the Martian landscape and is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest. Mars has fascinated scientists and astronomers for centuries, with its dusty surface, mysterious seasons, and evidence of ancient river beds and lakes. Recent missions to Mars, like NASAs rovers and orbiters,
        have provided detailed images and data,
        revealing the planets geology and potential for past life. These missions are paving the way for future human exploration, as scientists plan for manned missions to Mars within the next few decades, aiming to unlock the secrets of our planetary neighbor.',
